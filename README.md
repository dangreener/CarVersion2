CarVersion2
===========
This project took between 10-15 hours. 
Features:
Users can login and demo Carousel. Additional acccess to feed, conversations and profil.

Issues: 
Had some difficulty with the alert delay. Currently there's an alert for an blank/incorrect password however there's no loading delay. Additionally had some issues with the second scrollview but I got the UIPageView to work. Finally, couldn't link back to the first screenâ€”I think I'm just missing the command there.

GIF should be attached within the Repository!
